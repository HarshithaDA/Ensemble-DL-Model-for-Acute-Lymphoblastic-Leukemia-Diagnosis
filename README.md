# Ensemble-DL-Model-for-Acute-Lymphoblastic-Leukemia-Diagnosis

Developed an ensemble deep learning model that combines different 5 CNN architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet, Xception, and NASNet Large) to enhance the accuracy of classifying the stages (benign, early, pre, pro) of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) from microscopic white blood cell images of patients.

Summarized the project and authored a paper that encapsulates the methods and analysis of the results obtained from the created ensemble model. Manuscript submitted for publication.
